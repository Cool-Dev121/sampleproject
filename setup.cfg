[bdist_wheel]
# This flag says to generate wheels that support both Python 2 and Python
# 3. If your code will not run unchanged on both Python 2 and 3, you will
# need to generate separate wheels for each Python version that you
# support. Setting the value of 'universal' to anything other than '1',
# 'true' or 'yes' (case insensitive) or removing this line will prevent
# bdist_wheel from trying to make a universal wheel. For more see:
